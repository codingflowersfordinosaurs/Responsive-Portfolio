        <p>A full-stack coder in the making at Columbia University- Engineering Intensive Coding Bootcamp, preparing myself to start a new career!</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I have free time, I am teaching myself Chinese, taking care of my plants and learning more about the specifics of optimal plant are, and taking photos of my plants and of places I travel to. Even more rare moments, I will find myself at the gym trying to work off all of the food I've eaten(especially hot pot)!</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>Other interests I have (that are not coding related) are: watching movies, Netflix, reading Fiction (sometimes non-fiction and biographies), eating and trying lots of food, and going to the gym to sit on a stationary bike, so I can watch movies!</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>I am kind. I am smart. I am important. Hire Me.</p>
